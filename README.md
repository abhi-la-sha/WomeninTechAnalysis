# Women in Tech Analysis

## This analysis explores the count of women in the technology industry using a dataset from HackerRank's Survey of 2018. I have used python libraries pandas,numpy and matplotlib for graphs.

### Summary of Analysis:
1) The percentage of women in the tech industry is **very low** compared to the men.
2) The distribution of age for women and men in the workforce, in general, is visualized using column graph, where we can see the **count of men is significantly higher than women**.
3) Analysis of age distribution of Women in workforce revealed that the **percentage of youth/young women in workforce is more** and **starts decreasing from 35+** .
4) Analysis of the 'Technology' field shows a too high column of men in tech compared to women in tech, i.e. approx **4:1 ratio of men:women** in technology.
5) Further breakdown by gender and 'CurrentRole' visualized using bar plots reflects that **majority of women in tech are currently students** *which indicates the rise of awareness of technology in women in recent years*. So we should continue providing support and guidance to young women through special programs sessions.
6) Also the current role breakdown shows that a major chunk of women in tech are **Software engineers**, **Full Stack developers**, **Back-end developers**, **web developers**, and so on. This shows that the awareness for other roles in technology is less in women so *we should arrange webinars and workshops to provide women for information and exposure to other roles*.
